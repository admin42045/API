HttpPost, HttpPut, HttpDelete - If a method return type is void, by default status code 204 No Content is returned.
HttpPost - When a new item is created, we should be returning status code 201 Item Created.
HttpPost - With 201 status code we should also include the location i.e URI of the newly created item. 
HttpDelete - When an item is not found, instead of returning NULL and status code 200 OK, 
return 404 Not Found status code along with a meaningful message such as "Employee with Id = 101 not found"
